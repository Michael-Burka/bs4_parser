# Python PEP Parser: An Overview

## Overview

The Python PEP Parser is a specialized tool designed for parsing and analyzing Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) directly from the official Python website. It utilizes Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and requests_cache for efficient HTTP requests handling. This tool provides functionalities like fetching the latest Python versions, new features, downloading Python documentation, and analyzing PEP statuses to ensure they match expected outcomes.

### Key Features

- **Fetching What's New**: Retrieves the latest features and improvements in Python.
- **Analyzing Latest Python Versions**: Extracts information on the latest Python versions, including their status.
- **Downloading Documentation**: Facilitates the download of the latest Python documentation for offline use.
- **PEP Status Analysis**: Parses PEPs to report on their statuses and checks for any discrepancies against expected values.

### Usage Scenarios

- **Developers and Researchers**: Ideal for Python developers, researchers, or anyone interested in keeping up with Python's evolution through PEPs.
- **Documentation Enthusiasts**: Useful for individuals requiring quick access to offline Python documentation.
- **Python Community Contributors**: Helps contributors identify discrepancies in PEP statuses, aiding in maintaining the accuracy of Python's documentation.

## Getting Started

### Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**: Find the project on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment**: Before installing the dependencies, create a virtual environment to keep them isolated from your global Python environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Unix/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running the following command within your virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Navigate to the `src` directory**: Change into the `src` directory where the `main.py` script is located.
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```
5. **Run the script**: Execute the script with the desired option by running:
    ```bash
    python main.py [-h] [-c] [-o {pretty,file}] {whats-new,latest-versions,download,pep}
    ```

### Command Line Arguments

The script supports several command line arguments for various operations:

- **Positional arguments**:
    - `{whats-new,latest-versions,download,pep}`: Selects the mode of operation for the parser.

- **Optional arguments**:
    - `-h, --help`: Shows the help message and exits.
    - `-c, --clear-cache`: Clears the cache to ensure the script fetches the latest data.
    - `-o {pretty,file}, --output {pretty,file}`: Specifies the output mode. `pretty` for console-friendly display and `file` for saving the output to a file.

### Example Usage

To fetch the latest features in Python and display them in a console-friendly format:
```bash
python main.py whats-new --output pretty

```

## Detailed Functionality

### What's New (`whats_new`)

Fetches and displays a list of new features from the latest Python version, providing links to detailed descriptions.

### Latest Versions (`latest_versions`)

Extracts and presents the latest Python versions along with their development status, facilitating users to stay updated with the newest releases.

### Download (`download`)

Enables downloading the most recent Python documentation in a compressed format, making it accessible for offline use.

### PEP Status Analysis (`pep`)

This core functionality parses each PEP page, compares the PEP's status against expected values, and logs any discrepancies found, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.

## Security Considerations

While using this parser, it's crucial to ensure that:

- The sources of PEPs are always verified against the official Python website to prevent any data tampering.
- Users should be cautious when downloading and executing files from the internet to avoid potential security risks.
